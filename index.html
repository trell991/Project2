      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <P>
  Greetings, my name is Tai Harrell. I am transfer stuednt studying Imformation
Technology and Managemant at Illinois Tech. I am expecting to graduate in 2022
with a bachelors degree and would like to get my masters as well. I am from the
south side of Chicago go sox! In my free time I enjoy playing video games,
playing tennis and fooling around on all types of instruments. I grew up in
church playing piano and drums so those are some of my favorites. I started
playing tennis when I was about 9 years old and I have been playing ever since.
Some of my favorite video games are Call of duty, Dungeon deffenders, apex
legends and Grand theft auto. In the future I hope to find a career that I am
passinoite about and enjoy. Aditionally I hope that I fimd a career that challanges
me and builds my skills.
